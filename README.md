Sanity check
===

## I decided to write my blog completely in Clojure (well a little CSS won't hurt).
### At the moment I am using:
 * Compojure + Ring for handling HTTP requests.
 * Hiccup for HTML(5) rendering.
 * JDBC + Postgresql for the database.

 **Anything can (and will) change in the future, this is just my Scratchpad.**
